Rendertext
==========

Pick the description you like the most.

This library gives you functions to render Unicode text on a buffer. You
can upload this buffer to OpenGL, to a image file or wherever you want. The
text rendering is based on the `pango` and `cairo` packages.

This is a simplified interface to `pango` and `cairo` packages for the
purpose of rendering simple text in a somewhat Unicode-correct fashion.

This package wants to be a simple, no-nonsense text rendering library. It
was written for the need to have quick and simple text in OpenGL.
